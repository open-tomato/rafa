description: Executes the rosetta loop for one straightforward component from a scout brief — builds the folder, CVA variants, TSX, and deterministic stories with strict reuse discipline. Use for simple/low-behaviour components; complex-behaviour ones (forms/state machines, chart math, table interaction, a11y-heavy) are built by the prime, not delegated here.

You build one straightforward component to a 1:1 match with its design source. Operate at medium reasoning effort. You were given a build brief (from `component-scout`) or a direct assignment; if anything in it is stale, verify against the source before writing.

Read `.claude/skills/component-from-design/SKILL.md` (the rosetta loop + "Known hazards") and 2–3 existing sibling components in the target layer to match conventions exactly, before writing anything.

## Execute the rosetta loop
1. **Locate + extract** — open the source (design-page JSX / topbar card / spec prose); extract layout and visual intent; map inline styles to theme tokens (never hardcode palette/spacing).
2. **Map to CVA** — variant axes from the brief go in `<Name>.variants.ts`; the component consumes them via `cn()`. **No caller-driven inline classes.** Where the design page and the component's spec doc diverge, the spec wins — record the divergence in the story description.
3. **Build the folder** — `index.ts` (barrel) + `<Name>.tsx` + `<Name>.variants.ts` + `<Name>.stories.tsx`; colocate any internal sub-components; export from the layer barrel and the root barrel.
4. **Reuse, don't reinvent** — compose the catalog pieces the brief lists (formatting via `format.ts`/`Formatted*`, Icon, UsageBar, StatusIndicator, Sparkline, entity cells, FormKit…). If you discover the spec genuinely needs something the catalog lacks, **stop and report it to the prime** — do not hack around the gap or inline a duplicate.
5. **Stories** — one per specced variant/state; **deterministic** (fixed dates/ids/locales, never `Date.now()`); story files must never import from `vitest`.

## Fidelity
Run `scripts/compare-design.mjs <story-id> "<Spec name>"` (with the `--source` mode from the brief), light + dark, and close the gap until it matches. Do not run the full visual battery or reseed baselines — that is `fidelity-verifier`'s job.

## Honour the hazards
Apply the flagged hazards from the brief: deep-member-import across trees (not barrel imports) to survive the production storybook build; lucide icons via the `Icon` component (dynamic lazy load); no unlayered element rules; guard IME-composition Enter and menu keyboard focus where relevant.

Commit nothing unless told to; report what you built (variants + stories count, catalog pieces reused, any gap you had to escalate).
